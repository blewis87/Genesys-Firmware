Some notes about some interesting parts of the system.

2017Jan25-JG: #use functions are handled by the compiler pre-processor.  
   #USE DELAY is remains in effect through the entire compilation until another 
   #USE DELAY is encountered.  
   See "Duplicate USE" in the help file for a poor explanation.
   Double check that there is no confusion in Brian's code in that regard.
 
2017Jan25-JG: STKPTR=__ statement in a subroutine seems quite dangerous to me.
   Discuss with Brian.
 
See E309
   2017Jan26-JG: fl_alt_LCD added to control JG display / Brian display
   as dictated by SW1....
 
See E309
   2017Jan27-JG:  VERSION and VERSION_TEXT should both be representations of the
   same thing.  In the case of VERSION_TEXT defined to be A101, e.g., we could
   use hex 16-bit A101 for VERSION.  The LV program receives only 2-bytes for
   VERSION, so we should stick with letter a-f only, I think.
 
See E309
   2017Jan27-JG:  there was an extra character placed on the screen
   at position 1,15 to indicate mote state.  This has been removed and is
   no seen on the alt LCD display during SW1

   2017Jan31-JG: Note pullup enabled on SW1/LED1 line.  This needs checking
   with o-scope, etc.

	Added LCD "Page" functionality
	Added RB4 IOC functionality
	Cleaned up LCD stuff a bit

   2017Feb03-JG:  We may get a RPM setting too high message sent by sprinkler 
   resulting from control loop execution.  Look into this and understand when
   this is important and when not...  It appears as if sometimes this msg may
   be sent erroneously.
  
E311
   2017Feb04-JG:  It is apparent that the switchover during RPM control 
   algorithm from charging only to charging+braking is not well-controlled.
   Saw RPM with fixture hookup in lab here vary greatly at the crossover.  Is
   this a problem (perhaps not, but worth staring at for a while).
  
LV9.10
   2017Feb04-JG:  It might be nice to have a button for full open valve on the
   screen for TEST RPM CONTROL.
  
E311
   2017Feb04-JG:  Work allowing full open and full close WITHOUT first
   performing a valve calibration is ongoing.  I added a test for whether or
   not the valve set instruction is for FULL OPEN or FULL CLOSE.  I added the
   alternative OPEN_VALVE_UNKNOWN_STATE to be queued up instead of MOVE_VALVE.
   CLOSE_VALVE_UNKNOWN_STATE remains a work in progress, although the code
   for it has been added.
  
E311
   2017Feb04-JG:  Having some trouble reliably replicating the bug having to
   do with the sprinkler-initiated messages being repeated and that queue
   misbehaving.  Other circumstances confusing the debug process as of today.

E311
   2017Feb08-JG:  weak pullup may be needed on RB1 depending on 
   valve/xdcr header functionality moving forward (new PCB).  RB4
   still needs weak pullup as it is SW1. RB5 may need a weak pullup again
   depending on valve/xdcr header functionality moving forward (new PCB).

	Cleanup
	Added SYSTEM_IDLE
	Added Force Valve

   2017Feb09-JG:  No need to init Timer5 as EXTERNAL_SYNC, EXTERNAL is enough...
  
E313
   2017Feb11-JG:  Need to explore under what conditions an RPM setting too high
   error is issued.  May be OK, but awkward during bench testing when a) test
   fixture power is removed and then b) firmware drops into 'idle (sys state 3)
   and then c) power is returned to fixture.
