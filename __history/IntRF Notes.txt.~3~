Some notes about some interesting parts of the system.

2017Jan25-JG: #use functions are handled by the compiler pre-processor.  
 #USE DLAY is remains in effect through the entire compilation until another 
 #USE DELAY is encountered.  
 See "Duplicate USE" in the help file for a poor explanation.
 Double check that there is no confusion in Brian's code in that regard.
 
2017Jan25-JG: STKPTR=__ statement in a subroutine seems quite dangerous to me.
 Discuss with Brian.
 
See E309
2017Jan26-JG: fl_alt_LCD added to control JG display / Brian display
 as dictated by SW1....
 
See E309
2017Jan27-JG:  VERSION and VERSION_TEXT should both be representations of the
 same thing.  In the case of VERSION_TEXT defined to be A101, e.g., we could
 use hex 16-bit A101 for VERSION.  The LV program receives only 2-bytes for
 VERSION, so we should stick with letter a-f only, I think.
 
See E309
2017Jan27-JG:  there was an extra character placed on the screen
 at position 1,15 to indicate mote state.  This has been removed and is
 no seen on the alt LCD display during SW1

 2017Jan31-JG: Note pullup enabled on SW1/LED1 line.  This needs checking
  with o-scope, etc.  
  
E311
  2017Feb03-JG:  We may get a RPM setting too high message sent by sprinkler 
  resulting from control loop execution.  Look into this and understand when
  this is important and when not...  It appears as if sometimes this msg may
  be sent erroneously.

  2017Feb04-JG:  It is apparent that the switchover during RPM control 
  algorithm from charging only to charging+braking is not well-controlled.
  Saw RPM with fixture hookup in lab here vary greatly at the crossover.  Is
  this a problem (perhaps not, but worth staring at for a while).
